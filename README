CRMFinder is an algorithm to find cis-regulatory modules based on motifs in two
homologous intergenic regions. These motifs can be found based on conservation or
position weight matrices of known TFBSs, which should be stored in a file called
pwm.txt.

 Use GenomeCRMFinder gene1ID gene2ID sequence1.fasta sequence2.fasta genes1.fasta genes2.fasta occupancy.bed

 Gene IDs are for two homologous genes.
 Sequence data should be in fasta format.
 Genes data should be the corresponding gff3 file.
 Occupancy is an optional argument.

 Before running CRMFinder the parameters should be set in the parameters.txt file

 method can be known or conserved
 score is the score cutoff
 region is the length of the CRM
 length is the length of the conserved motif
 likelihood is the likelihood cutoff for known motifs
 a is the weight of percent matching
 b is the weight of the distance score
 c is the weight of the order score
 d is the weight of average nucleasome occupancy

 Good parameters are:
 method:conserved
 score:4
 region:120
 length:8
 likelihood:-7
 a:10
 b:5
 c:2
 d:1

 Example run:

 CRMFinder was written by William Colgan and Pravadh Singh as a CS68 final project.
